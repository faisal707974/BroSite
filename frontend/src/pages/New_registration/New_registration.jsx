                    <h4>Guidelines for enrolled candidates</h4>

Your enrolment has been confirmed for our batch starting Kochi. Please go through the following guidelines to make your preparations comfortable.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The first segment of the programme is a 3 Days Workshop which will be conducted on the above mentioned venue and time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reach the venue in time. Outstation candidates who were staying in the hostel may reach the hostel by previous day evening, to ensure that they arrive at the venue on time the next day.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Follow the Covid protocol, including wearing a mask and carrying hand sanitizer
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Being in formal attire is very important. Wear formal pants, tuck in your shirt and wear formal shoes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After the 3 Days workshop, the rest of the programme will be conducted at the BROCAMP mentioned above. The location details are furnished below, and the outstation candidates have to arrange their accommodation near to this location.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Because our programme is more of a residential one, individuals staying at the hostel should bring the required luggage for a comfortable stay. Outstation candidates should avoid commuting frequently from their homes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You are free to choose any options for your accommodation and try to make it as near as possible to our venue. It is solely your obligation to arrange your stay, and we provide no commitments in this regard. On your request, the publicly available information on the hostel owners may be shared.
                        </li>
